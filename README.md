Comparison of Y.music User Behavior in The Two Sample Cities

**In this project, we'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. We'll study real Yamdex.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.**

# Goal

Test three Hypothesis:
  1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
  2. On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shellbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
  3. Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have diffrent preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

# Stages
Data on user behavior is stored in the file /datasets/music_project_en.csv. There is no information about the quality of the data, so you will need to explore it before testing the hypothesis.

First, you'll evaluate the quality of the data and see whether its issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will try to account for the most critical problems.

**This project will consist of three stages:**

  1. Data overview
  2. Data preprocessing
  3. Testing the hypothesis
